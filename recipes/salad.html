    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Asian slaw recipe is filled with my favorite summer 
        ingredients - fresh herbs & peaches - and tossed in a 
        tangy miso dressing. Perfect for picnics!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Crunchy green and red cabbage/li>
        <li>Charred peppers</li>
        <li>Green onions, cilantro, mint & basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together 
            the cashew butter, miso paste, lime juice, sesame 
            oil, and ginger. Whisk in enough water to create a 
            drizzable consistency. Set aside..</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat, 
            char the peppers whole, rotating until the 
            edges have a little char, about 2 minutes 
            per side. Remove. When cool to the touch, 
            slice in half lengthwise, remove the stem,
             ribbing, and seeds and slice horizontally 
             into thin strips.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, 
            peppers, scallions, cilantro, basil, 
            chiles, and Â¾ of the dressing. Toss until 
            combined. Add the remaining dressing, if 
            desired, and season to taste with a few
             pinches of sea salt. Serve topped with the
              toasted nuts, seeds, and sliced peaches.</li>

    </ol>
